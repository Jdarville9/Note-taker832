This application is a simple note taking app.  

## Usage
Upon opening Note-Taker832 your previously saved notes will generate in the left field. You can add a note by clicking within the text fields titled 'Note Title' and 'Note Text.' Once, both fields have user input, click the save icon, located in the top left corner. If you click on an existing note from the left field, the text will generate into the two input fields.
